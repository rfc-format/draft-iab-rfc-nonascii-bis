    <abstract>
      <t>
In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more
diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for 
the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the 
required language of the Series, the encoding of future RFCs will
be in UTF-8, allowing for a broader range of characters than typically
used in the English language.  This document describes the RFC Editor 
requirements and gives guidance regarding the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
For much of the history of the RFC Series, the character encoding used
for RFCs has been <xref target="RFC20" format="default">ASCII</xref>.  
This was a sensible choice at the time: the language of the Series has
always been English, a language that primarily uses ASCII-encoded characters 
(ignoring for a moment words borrowed from more richly decorated alphabets); 
and, ASCII is the "lowest common denominator" for character encoding, making 
cross-platform viewing trivial.
</t>
      <t>
There are limits to ASCII, however, that hinder its continued use as the
exclusive character encoding for the Series.  The increasing need for 
easily readable, internationalized content suggests it is time to allow 
non-ASCII characters in RFCs where necessary.  To support this move away 
from ASCII, RFCs will switch to supporting UTF-8 as the default character 
encoding and will allow support for a broad range of Unicode characters 
<xref target="UnicodeCurrent" format="default"/>.  Note that the RFC Editor may reject any code point that does not render 
adequately across all formats or in enough rendering engines using the v3
tooling.
</t>
      <t>
Given the continuing goal of maximum readability across platforms, the
use of non-ASCII characters should be limited to only where 
necessary within the text.  This document describes the rules under which 
non-ASCII characters may be used in an RFC.  These rules will be applied 
as the necessary changes are made to submission checking and editorial
tools.
</t>
      <t>
This document updates the <xref target="RFC7322" format="default">RFC Style Guide</xref>.
</t>
      <t>The details included in this document are expected to change based on
experience gained in implementing the new publication toolsets. Revised
documents will be published capturing those changes as the toolsets are
completed. Other implementers must not expect those changes to remain
backwards compatible with the details included in this document.</t>

      <name>Basic Requirements</name>
      <t>
Two fundamental requirements inform the guidance and examples provided
in this document.  They are:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Searches against RFC indexes and database tables need to return
expected results and support appropriate Unicode string matching
behaviors; </li>
        <li>RFCs must be able to be displayed correctly across a wide range of
readers and browsers.  People whose systems do not have the fonts needed to
display a particular RFC need to be able to read the various publication 
formats and the XML correctly in order to understand and implement the 
information described in the document.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Rules for the Use of Non-ASCII Characters</name>
      <t>
This section describes the guidelines for the use of non-ASCII characters 
in an RFC.  If the RFC Editor identifies areas where the use of non-ASCII 
characters negatively impacts 
the readability of the text, they will request alternate text.
</t>
      <t>
The RFC Editor may, in cases of entire words represented in non-ASCII
characters, ask for a set of reviewers to verify the meaning, spelling, 
characters, and grammar of the text.
</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>General Usage throughout a Document</name>
        <t>
Where the use of non-ASCII characters is purely part of an example
and not otherwise required for correct protocol operation, escaping 
the non-ASCII character is not required.  Note, however, that as the 
language of the RFC Series is English, the use of non-ASCII characters 
is based on the spelling of words commonly used in the English language 
following the guidance in the <xref target="MerrWeb" format="default">Merriam-Webster 
dictionary</xref>. 
</t>
        <t>
The RFC Editor will use the primary spelling listed in that dictionary
by default.
</t>
        <t>Example of non-ASCII characters that do not require escaping
(example from Section 3.1.1.12 of RFC 4475 <xref target="RFC4475" format="default"/>, with a hex dump
replaced by the actual character glyphs):

Person names may appear in several places within an RFC (e.g., the header, Acknowledgements, and References). When a script

Authors should not expect normalization forms <xref target="UNICODE-NORM" format="default"/>to be preserved. If a
particular normalization form is expected, note that in the text of the

      <t>As described above, use of non-ASCII characters in areas such as
email, company name, address, and name is allowed. In order to make it 
easier for code to identify the appropriate ASCII alternatives, authors
must include an "ascii" attribute to their XML markup when an ASCII 
alternative is required.  See <xref target="RFC7991" format="default"/> for 
more detail on how to tag ASCII alternatives.

      <t>
The ability to use non-ASCII characters in RFCs in a clear and consistent 
manner will improve the ability to describe internationalized protocols 
and will recognize the diversity of authors. However, the goal of readability
will override the use of non-ASCII characters within the text.

          <abstract>
            <t>Application protocols using Unicode characters in protocol strings need to properly handle such strings in order to enforce internationalization rules for strings placed in various protocol slots (such as addresses and identifiers) and to perform valid comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or authorization).  This document defines a framework enabling application protocols to perform the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized strings ("PRECIS") in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode characters and thus is agile with respect to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework provides a more sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings than the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  This document obsoletes RFC 3454.</t>
